## Work Experience
**Machine Learning Engineer @ GIGATECH, BEXIMCO (_September 2022 - Present_)**
- Created a multi‚Äëtask named entity recognition (NER) and Parts of Speech (POS) model that achieved state‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëart results in Bangla language
by efficiently using external context from Wikipedia. 
- Used Pytorch Profiler to reduce bottlenecks, Nvidia TensorRT to optimize the model and deployed this optimized model using Nvidia Triton Inference Server (TIS).
- Created pre‚Äëtraining scripts to train state‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëart language models like GPT2, BERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTa using Distributed Data‚ÄëParallel (DDP)
strategy on multiple GPUs.
- Collaborated with linguists to develop the tagset guidelines of Named Entity recognition, Parts of Speech and Lemmatization for Bangla lan‚Äë
guage to facilitate large‚Äëscale annotation of Bangla Natinal Corpus(bdNC).

**Research Assistant (Remote) @ Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) (_Septembert 2021 - December 2021_)**
- Pretrained a HuBERT model on Bangla ASR dataset for joint task of speech and speaker recognition pipeline using SpeechBrain.
- Assisted in enriching existing open source Bangla ASR datasets by adding more scirpted audion and correcting existing annotation.

**Teacher Assistant & BRAC University (_April 2020 - April 2022_)**
- Helped students with different coding assignments and helped teachers in checking scripts
- Assisted students in conducting research in various fields and submitting papers into conference.
- Assisted Teachers in lab classes and helped students with different course materials during consultation hour.

## Projects
### Bangla Clickbait Detector App
[repo](https://github.com/MotaharMahtab/Bangla-Clickbait-Detector-App)
-  Demo app created as a part of research work on Bangla Clickbait Detection using GAN‚ÄëTransformers. It takes a Bangla article title as input and
outputs whether the title is a clickbait or non‚Äëclickbait along with the prediction probability score. GAN‚ÄëTransformers is a Transformer network
trained in generative adversarial training framework.
- Tools used: Pytorch, Streamlit, Node.js

### Bangla Article Headline Categorizer App
[repo](https://github.com/MotaharMahtab/Bangla-Headline-Categorizer-App)

- Can categorize Bangla article headlines into eight different categories ‚Äë Economy, Education, Entertainment, Politics, International, Sports,
National, and Science & Technology
- Models used: State‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëart Bangla ELECTRA model, Dataset used: Patrika Dataset. ‚Äë contains 400ùëò Bangla news articles from prominent
Bangla news sites.

### Veggy - Vegetarian Recipe Maker App
[repo](https://github.com/MotaharMahtab/django_vegetarian_recipe)

- This web app allows users to view different vegetarian recipes, see their total calories, nutrients like protein, carbohydrate, fat and their ingre‚Äë
dients.
- Users can create their own vegetarian recipes by mixing different ingredients available on the web app. They can also see the total nutrients
and calories of their created recipe
- Tools used: Django, Bootstrap, Node.js
